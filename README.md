My personal blog site written in go

Feel free to use it, but first a few points

- It makes no attempts to be generic, its my personal site
- It has no fancy interface, articles are posted by curling the article
  endpoint and passing an html file, I like to write it Vim not a web interface
- It is not yet complete, it is still a little rough around the edges
- The database is very simple. Take a look at the schema if you don't believe me
- I will keep adding to it, so I make no gaurentees of its stability
