My personal blog site written in go

Feel free to use it, but first a few points

- It makes no attempts to be generic, its my personal site
- It has no fancy interface, articles are posted by curling the article
  endpoint and passing an html file, I like to write it Vim not a web interface
- It is not yet complete, it is still a little rough around the edges
- The database is very simple. Take a look at the schema if you don't believe me
- I will keep adding to it, so I make no gaurentees of its stability

If you think you can improve something, please submit a PR.  This was a weekend
project so there are a number of issues with the current code base.  I do not
want to incorporate fancy features like a CMS or admin interface, but bug fixes
and geeky additions are always welcome.  If you do add something like an admin
interface, then feel free to send me a link.

If you do put in a PR, please do not edit the content in index.html or
contact.html.  Like I said, this is my personal site.  I have just open sourced
it in case someone else might find this useful/interesting
